}
\arguments{
\item{bfl}{A \code{BamFile} or \code{BamFileList} object, or a character
string vector of BAM filenames.}

\item{teFeatures}{A \code{GRanges} or \code{GRangesList} object with the
transposable element (TE) annotated features to be quantified. Elements in 
this object should have names, which are used as a grouping factor for 
genomic ranges forming a common locus, unless other metadata column names are 
specified in the \code{aggregateby} parameter.}

\item{aggregateby}{Character vector with column names in the annotation
to be used to aggregate quantifications. By default, this is an empty vector,
which means that the names of the input \code{GRanges} or \code{GRangesList}
object given in the \code{teFeatures} parameter are used to aggregate
quantifications.}

\item{geneFeatures}{A \code{GRanges} or \code{GRangesList} object with the
gene annotated features to be quantified. Overlaps with unique reads are 
first tallied with respect to these gene features. Elements should have 
names indicating the gene name/id. In case that \code{geneFeatures} contains
a metadata column named \code{type}, only the elements with 
\code{type} = \code{exon} are considered for the analysis. Then, exon
counts are summarized to the gene level.}

\item{singleEnd}{(Default TRUE) Logical value indicating if reads are single
(\code{TRUE}) or paired-end (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{ignoreStrand}{(Default TRUE) A logical which defines if the strand
should be taken into consideration when computing the overlap between reads
and annotated features. When \code{ignore_strand = FALSE}, an aligned read
is considered to be overlapping an annotated feature as long as they
have a non-empty intersecting genomic range on the same strand, while when
\code{ignoreStrand = TRUE} the strand is not considered.}

\item{strandMode}{(Default 1) Numeric vector which can take values 0, 1 or 2.
The strand mode is a per-object switch on
\code{\link[GenomicAlignments:GAlignmentPairs-class]{GAlignmentPairs}}
objects that controls the behavior of the strand getter. See
\code{\link[GenomicAlignments:GAlignmentPairs-class]{GAlignmentPairs}}
class for further detail. If \code{singleEnd = TRUE}, then \code{strandMode}
is ignored.}

\item{fragments}{(Default not \code{singleEnd}) A logical; applied to
paired-end data only. When \code{fragments=TRUE}, the read-counting
method in the original ERVmap algorithm is applied: each mate of a
paired-end read is counted once and, therefore, two mates mapping to the
same element result in adding up a count value of two. When
\code{fragments=FALSE}, if the two mates of a paired-end read map to the same
element, they are counted as a single hit and singletons, reads with unmapped
pairs and other fragments, are not counted.}

\item{maxMismatchRate}{(Default 0.02) Numeric value storing the maximum mismatch
rate employed by the ERVmap algorithm to discard aligned reads whose rate
of sum of hard and soft clipping or whose rate of the edit distance over the 
genome reference to the length of the read is above this threshold.}

\item{suboptimalAlignmentTag}{(Default "auto") Character string storing the
tag name in the BAM files that stores the suboptimal alignment score used in
the third filter of ERVmap; see 
\href{https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1814589115}{Tokuyama et al. (2018)}. 
The default, \code{suboptimalAlignmentTag="auto"}, first extracts the name of 
the read mapper software from one or more BAM files. If BAM files were 
generated by BWA, the suboptimal alignment scores are obtained from a tag 
called \code{XS}. For other read mappers, the suboptimal alignment score 
is considered to be missing since, except from BWA, no other aligner
provides a tag with suboptimal alignment scores. In this case, the available 
secondary alignments are used to implement an analogous approach to that
of the third ERVmap filter. When \code{suboptimalAlignmentTag="none"}, it also 
performs the latter approach even when the tag \code{XS} is available. When
this parameter is different from \code{"auto"} and \code{"none"}, a tag
with the given name is used to extract the suboptimal alignment score.}

\item{suboptimalAlignmentCutoff}{(Default 5) Numeric value storing the cutoff
above which the difference between the alignment score and the suboptimal
alignment score is considered sufficiently large to retain the alignment. 
When this value is set to \code{NA}, the filtering step based on suboptimal
alignment scores is skipped.}

\item{geneCountMode}{(Default \code{"all"}) Character string indicating if 
the ERVmap read filters applied to quantify TEs expression should also be 
applied when quantifying gene expression (\code{"ervmap"}) or not 
(\code{"all"}), in which case all primary alignments mapping to genes are 
counted.}

\item{object}{A \linkS4class{ERVmapParam} object.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{ERVmapParam} object.
}
\description{
This is a class for storing parameters provided to the ERVmap algorithm.
It is a subclass of the 'AtenaParam-class'.

Build an object of the class \code{ERVmapParam}
}
\details{
This is the constructor function for objects of the class
\code{ERVmapParam-class}. This type of object is the input to the
function \code{\link{qtex}()} for quantifying expression of transposable
elements using the ERVmap method
\href{https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1814589115}{Tokuyama et al. (2018)}. The
ERVmap algorithm processes reads following conservative filtering criteria
to provide reliable raw count data for each TE.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{readMapper}}{The name of the software used to align reads, obtained from
the BAM file header.}

\item{\code{singleEnd}}{(Default FALSE) Logical value indicating if reads are single
(\code{TRUE}) or paired-end (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{\code{strandMode}}{(Default 1) Numeric vector which can take values 0, 1 or 2.
The strand mode is a per-object switch on
\code{\link[GenomicAlignments:GAlignmentPairs-class]{GAlignmentPairs}}
objects that controls the behavior of the strand getter. See
\code{\link[GenomicAlignments:GAlignmentPairs-class]{GAlignmentPairs}}
class for further detail. If \code{singleEnd = TRUE}, then
\code{strandMode} #'   is ignored.}

\item{\code{ignoreStrand}}{(Default TRUE) A logical which defines if the strand
should be taken into consideration when computing the overlap between reads
and TEs in the annotations. When \code{ignore_strand = FALSE}, only those
reads which overlap the TE and are on the same strand are counted. On the
contrary, when \code{ignore_strand = TRUE}, any read overlapping an element
in \code{teFeatures} is counted regardless of the strand.}

\item{\code{fragments}}{(Default not \code{singleEnd}) A logical; applied to
paired-end data only. When \code{fragments=TRUE} (default), the read-counting
method in the original ERVmap algorithm will be applied: each mate of a
paired-end read is counted once and, therefore, two mates mapping to the
same element result in adding up a count value of two. When
\code{fragments=FALSE}, if the two mates of a paired-end read map to the same
element, they are counted as a single hit and singletons, reads with unmapped
pairs and other fragments, are not counted.}

\item{\code{maxMismatchRate}}{(Default 0.02) Numeric value storing the maximum
mismatch rate employed by the ERVmap algorithm to discard aligned reads
whose rate of sum of hard and soft clipping, or of the edit distance over
the genome reference, to the length of the read is above this threshold.}

\item{\code{suboptimalAlignmentTag}}{(Default "auto") Character string storing the
tag name in the BAM files that stores the suboptimal alignment score used in
the third filter of ERVmap; see Tokuyama et al. (2018). The default,
\code{suboptimalAlignmentTag="auto"}, assumes that either the BAM files were
generated by BWA and include a tag called \code{XS} that stores the
suboptimal alignment score or, if the \code{XS} tag is not available, then
it uses the available secondary alignments to implement an analogous approach
to that of the third ERVmap filter. When \code{suboptimalAlignmentTag="none"},
it also performs the latter approach even when the tag \code{XS} is available.
When this parameter is different from \code{"auto"} and \code{"none"}, a tag
with the given name is used to extract the suboptimal alignment score.
The absence of that tag will prompt an error.}

\item{\code{suboptimalAlignmentCutoff}}{(Default 5) Numeric value storing the cutoff
above which the difference between the alignment score and the suboptimal
alignment score is considered sufficiently large to retain the alignment.
When this value is set to \code{NA}, then the filtering step based on
suboptimal alignment scores is skipped.}

\item{\code{geneCountMode}}{(Default "all") Character string indicating if the ERVmap
read filters applied to quantify TEs expression should also be applied when
quantifying gene expression ("ervmap") or not ("all"), in which case all
primary alignments mapping to genes are counted.}
