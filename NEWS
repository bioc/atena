CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.0 (2023-04-20)
-------------------------------------

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Improvement of the accuracy of the atena expression quantification method.

    o Fixed numerical instability in TEtranscripts method.

    o Added function (.matchSeqinfo) to harmonize seqinfo() of object with alignments and object with feature annotations.

    o Implemented 'OneCodeToFindThemAll' annotation parser for RepeatMasker annotations.

    o Implemented 'atena' annotation parser for RepeatMasker annotations.

    o Added examples in the vignettes of TE annotation preprocessing steps using the implemented parsers.

    o Changed default value of geneFeatures to NULL in the parameters objects.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug for not properly paired reads.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.4.0 (2022-11-31)
---------------------------------------

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Implemented 'choose', 'average' and 'conf' reassignment modes in Telescope method.
    o Creation of a 4th expression quantification method, called the atena method.
    o Modified 'ovUnion' method to address alignments overlapping > 1 feature.
    o Implemented 'OvIntersectionStrict' overlapping method.
    o Adapted annotaTEs() function to new RepeatMasker annotations in AnnotationHub.
